# Road Wear Adjuster
Adjust the texture, brightness, opacity, smoothness of the road wear. This mod is a purely cosmetic mod, it **does not** affect gameplay. As such, it should be safe to your saves.

[Update]: The game has been updated so dark road wear is now the default without the mod. Still, if you would like change the road wear, perhaps to something lighter, you can use this mod.
(Previously: If you're aiming for dark road wear, decrease the brightness and increase the opacity. I also recommend decreasing smoothness, as reflected light will cause the road wear to appear lighter)

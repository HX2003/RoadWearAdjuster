# Road Wear Adjuster
Adjust the texture, brightness, opacity, smoothness of the road wear. This mod is a purely cosmetic mod, it **does not** affect gameplay. As such, it should be safe to your saves.

If you're aiming for dark road wear, decrease the brightness and increase the opacity. I also recommend decreasing smoothness, as reflected light will cause the road wear to appear lighter.

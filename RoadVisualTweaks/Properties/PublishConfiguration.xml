# Road Visual Tweaks
Adjust the appearance of road wear, bus and bicycle lanes. Each type can be individually toggled on or off.

[Note]: You can configure the base texture to use the original ones, or my custom reflavoured ones. The reflavoured textures are stored in C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\.cache\Mods\mods_subscribed\96718_6\textures, (this number 96718_6 may change?) but I've only customized the Road Wear texture.

[Note]: This mod is a purely cosmetic mod, it does not affect gameplay. As such, it should be safe to your saves.

[Note]: The game has been updated so dark road wear is now the default without the mod. Still, if you would like change the road wear, perhaps to something lighter, you can use this mod.
